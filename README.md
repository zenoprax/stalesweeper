## Permissions

For the execution of this action, it must be able to fetch all discussions from
your repository. To do this, you'll need to provide a `repo-token` with the
necessary permissions. If you're using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, you'll need
to add the following permission to your workflow at a minimum:

```yaml
permissions:
  discussions: read
```

Depending on the configuration, the action may require additional permissions
(e.g., to add comments). In this case, you might need to extend the permissions
in your workflow:

```yaml
permissions:
  discussions: write
```

## Example

Here's an example of a workflow that runs the action every day at midnight UTC.
It closes all discussions that have been inactive for 14 days and posts a
message on the discussion when closing it.

```yaml
name: Close Stale Discussions

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs every day at midnight UTC

jobs:
  close-stale-discussions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Run action
        uses: zenoprax/stalesweeper@main
        with:
          message: 'This discussion has been closed due to inactivity.'
          days-before-close: '14'
```

## Credits

The original GH Action was created by
[Steffen Karlsson](https://github.com/steffen-karlsson/stalesweeper) but it has
been unmaintained since early 2024.

This was forked by
[Nicholas VanCise (thenick775)](https://github.com/thenick775/stalesweeper) who
added a dry-run mode and proper logging for troubleshooting among other
improvements.

I decided to use it to help manage the thousands of open discussions for the
[Super Productivity](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity)
task manager and wanted to have full control over its availability and
functionality.
